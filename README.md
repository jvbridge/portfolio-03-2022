A small smattering of a portfolio!

<br /> 
<hr />

This portfolio is also a showcase in itself of what can be done
It is written just in HTML and CSS on its own but will occasionally be updated
as I update my skills.

## Wireframe

There are two wireframes used for this project one for the desktop version and 
the other for the mobile version. Both were made using google slides.
